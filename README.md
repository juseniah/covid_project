# COVID-19 Project
## By Jussi Doherty

This is a personal data analysis project on a COVID-19 data set provided by Our World in Data. Click the URL below to launch an interactive environment.

Using this data, we will answer the following questions:

1. In which countries is COVID-19 the biggest problem proportionate to population?
2. How is each continent faring with COVID-19?
3. How have vaccinations altered the trajectory of new infections around the world?
4. Are vaccinations working in the USA?

Project created in October 2021
